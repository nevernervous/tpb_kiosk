==== GENERAL ====

there is a web server on AWS that hosts multiple instances of wordpress. one for each customer. 
each instance has its on subdomain on .thepeakbeyond.com.

for example if the customer name is apex, then the customer instance of wordpress will be on:
apex.thepeakbeyond.com

since there is one instance of wordpress on AWS and one (or multiple) kiosks for a store,
a sync process is necessary.

the sync process works as following:
    - for each wordpress instance there is a /last.php script that will show when the last modification was made
    - the sync script on the kiosk will check periodically for changes on the main WP instance
    - if changes are detected, the sync script will do:
        - sync all files from the server to the kiosk
        - export and import the full database from the web server to the kiosk
        - update the local config of wp

the sync process relies on ssh keys to be setup on the kiosk that are accepted by the server.


for both the server and the kiosk, the install scripts are in the tpb-install repo.

==== WEB SERVER ====

the webserver is on a permanent IP: 34.208.129.6

- DNS setup for customer
    each customer will require a subdomain. in goDaddy, create an A record:
    sudomain.thepeakbeyond.com  34.208.129.6

    when a customer is decommissioned, simply remove the subdomain from goDaddy.

- customer setup
    each customer will require subdomain (setup in previous step DNS) and a WordPress instance.
    with the subdomain from the previous step, setup a new WP instance for each customer:

    - in the repo, navigate to server directory
    - run customer-add.sh script and follow the setup steps
    
- customer delete

    - in the repo, navigate to server directory
    - run customer-add.sh script and follow the instructions
    
    !! WARNING - running this script will delete all files and the database for the customer.


- databases
    all databases for wordpress are hosted outside the web server on an RDS instance.
    this makes for a more secure and reliable setup.

- add ssh key for the kiosk
    during the setup phase of a kiosk, there will be a prompt to add an ssh key to the server. 
    this step is very important, otherwise the sync process will not work.
    
    to add the ssh key for the kiosk:
        - ssh to the web server
            ssh -i linux-access.pem ubuntu@34.208.129.6
        - become root
            sudo su -
        - run the command you copied from the kiosk:
            echo 'ssh-rsa LONG_RSA_STRING_KEY' >> /home/site1/.ssh/authorized_keys
        - press 'y' on the kiosk to continue the setup process
        

- ssh access 
    ssh is running on two ports
    22    - for regular access - this is restricted to certain IPs and is controlled by AWS Security Groups
    37922 - for sync process - this is on a custom port and is open to the world. 
            the motivation to put the sync on a custom port is that it will allow kiosks coming from dynamic IPs to operate
             properly, even if the IP changes. 
             All while keeping the SSH port hidden, so automated scans will not detect it, 
             thus preventing bruteforce/hack attempts.

    To add a new IP to the AWS Security groups:
        - login to AWS
        - go to EC2 -> Security Group
        - select 'remote-access'
        - in the bottom panel select 'Inbound'
        - click 'Edit'
        - 'Add Rule' -> SSH
        - Source -> 'My IP'
        - Save


==== KIOSK SETUP ====
- become root:
    sudo su -
- run the setup.sh script in the repo, it will take care of setting things up, including sync process.
    cd WHERE-FILES-ARE
    ./setup.sh
