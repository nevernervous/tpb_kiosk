There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we've encountered in some time.

One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the \"greasy\" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses ? this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn't give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.<\/p>","photo":"http:\/\/branch-designs.com\/peakbeyond\/final_images\/303-kush-10_500x500.png","photo_update":"2017-01-10 15:08:17","moods":"Relaxed:100,Euphoric:63,Happy:57,Uplifted:48,Creative:42","medical":"Stress:100,Pain:96,Insomnia:91,Nausea:81,Depression:72","side_effects":"Dry Eyes:100,Dry Mouth:100,Anxious:23,Dizzy:23","strain_type":"Indica-dominant hybrid","prices":"1 unit:32.00,1 unit:32.00,1 unit:32.00,1 unit:32.00","reviews":null,"stars":null},{"strain_name":"32 (\"Three-Two\")","description":"<p>Albert Walker is a legendary clone-only Afghani skunk variety, while Manic is also an old-school Afghani, though with a sugary sweet smell.?
