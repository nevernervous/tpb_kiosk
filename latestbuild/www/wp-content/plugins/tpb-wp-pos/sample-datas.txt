The effect is a little more uplifting and active than Bubba traditionally is, but this 303 still had quality body relaxation properties that made the incredible mood it put us in even more enjoyable.<\/p>","aroma":"We were definitely \"wowed\" by the aroma that this Colorado-born cross possessed, as it was extremely pungent and reminded us of some of the best coffee-chocolate Bubbas we've had. There were notes of smokey bourbon, anise, and a backing sharp chemmy quality that came out post-grind, making this one of the most complex aromas we've encountered in some time. If you're a fan of the dank, spicy smells of Bubba Kush, this strain will likely surpass most examples of pure Bubba in your mind's eye, as it has in ours.<\/p>","flavor":"While it was nearly impossible to live up to the aroma, the taste did come close to matching it, though it lost some of the added post-grind complexity and was mostly Bubba in profile. One of the great things about Bubba Kush is the \"greasy\" flavor which seems to coat the mouth and sinuses \u2014 this sample was no exception there, and we could taste it lingering for at least a half hour into the review. The smoke had an interesting thin, mentholated quality to it and really didn't give us the urge to cough at all, even on the later hits.<\/p>","photo":"https:\/\/www.cannabisreports.com\/images\/extracts\/0\/full_0bf3128ec8bfaa454b23a9e824b357d695035f76.jpg","photo_update":"2017-01-12 15:08:17","strain_type":"Indica-dominant hybrid","prices":"ounce:107.50,half:53.75,eighth:15.17","reviews":null,"stars":null},{"strain_name":"White Mango - Shatter","description":"","category":"Concentrates","type":"Shatter","brand":"Rising Sun Extract","in_stock":"1","SKU":"testing","record_id":"86","last_updated":"2017-02-12 00:00:00","photo":"http:\/\/branch-designs.com\/peakbeyond\/final_images\/303-kush-10_500x500.png","prices":"1 unit:50.00"}]
